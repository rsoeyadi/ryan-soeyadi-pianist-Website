## Ryan Soeyadi, pianist (personal website)

You may view the website here: [www.ryansoeyadipianist.com](https://ryansoeyadipianist.com)

This is my musical website made to replace my Wix site. There isn't anything particularly fancy about this, although some of my first JavaScript code is written here (like the dynamic populating of the concerts page in populate.js). For the photogallery I use `FancyBox` and for the contact form, I use `Netlify` to take care of it. I'd like to eventually create a more modern website, but this does what I need for now.
