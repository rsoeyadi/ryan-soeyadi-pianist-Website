## Ryan Soeyadi, pianist (personal website)

You may view the website here: [www.ryansoeyadipianist.com](https://ryansoeyadipianist.com)

This is my musical website made to replace my Wix site. It is built with HTML/CSS and a sprinkle of JavaScript for the hamburger menu. For the photogallery I use `FancyBox` and for the contact form, I use `Netlify` to take care of it. I'd like to eventually create a more modern website, but this does what I need for now.
